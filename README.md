## 🌟 Final Notes

This is my final capstone project for the Year Up program — a full-circle moment in my journey as a developer.

EasyShop represents more than just a web app; it’s a stepping stone toward building tech that heals, connects, and empowers. Thank you to everyone who's supported me along the way — mentors, classmates, and every bug that tried to break my spirit (and nearly succeeded 😅).

Here’s to growth, grit, and glowing up one mood kit at a time. ✨
