## 🌟 Final Notes

This is our final capstone project for the Java Program — a full-circle moment in my journey to becoming a developer.

EasyShop represents more than just a web app. For me, it’s a stepping stone toward building tech that heals, connects, and empowers. Thank you to everyone who's supported me along the way — Maaike, my mentors, tutors, classmates, and every bug that tried to break my spirit (and nearly succeeded 😅).

Here’s to growth, grit, and pushing ourselves out of our comfort zones every day. ✨
